# Monorepo

This repository contains my various open source projects.

## Getting started

To get started, clone the repository and run `pnpm i` to install dependencies. Compile the code with `pnpm build`.

Start a service by using the `docker-compose` alias `tools/bin/mono`: `tools/bin/mono up -d <service>`.
